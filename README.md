# MWS-Certification-Study-Guide

## About
  
This repo is a collection of my personal notes taken while studying for [Google's Mobile Web Specialist Certification exam](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/mobile-web-specialist/).
I am posting it here for several reasons. 

1. Somebody may be searching for information much like I was and may find this information help them in their own decision to take the exam.
2. Posting this on GitHub is a good solution for being able to access my notes remotely and I can track my progress via the commit history.
I can also use the commit history to hold myself accountable to staying consistent.
3. I'm fond of markdown syntax for taking notes.

## Basic Website Layout and Styling
### [Responsive Web Design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/)
 * Design to cover screen sizes of many different devices
  * Always include meta viewport tag
    * Control the width and scaling of the browser’s viewport
    * `width=device-width` to match screen’s width in device-independent pixels
    * `initial-scale=1` establish 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels
    * Avoid disabling user scaling for better accessibility
  * Use CSS media queries for responsiveness
    * Use `min-width` over `min-device-width`
    * Use relative sizes
    * `@media` and `media` html attribute
      * Example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="small-screen.css" media="(min-width: 325px)">`
      * Example: `@media (min-width: 425px) { /* Styles go here */ } `
    * `@import` is possible but discouraged
    * Using `min-device-width` is strongly discouraged.
      * `min-width` is based on browser window. `min-device-width` is screen size. This is often not reported correctly. Also does not support screen resizing.
